# Bangladesh-Power-Data-Pipeline

**Authors:** Md. Ikrama Hossain, Tasnia Nafs, Sakif Yeaser, and Asif Newaz

This repository contains the Python-based scraping and preprocessing pipeline used to construct a multi-year dataset of daily electricity demand, generation, load shedding, and external conditions in Bangladesh.

The pipeline automates the retrieval of daily reports from the **Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)** digital archive, parses structured tables from PDFs, cleans and validates records, imputes missing values, enriches features (holidays, temperature, temporal attributes), and exports the data into machine-readable formats.
